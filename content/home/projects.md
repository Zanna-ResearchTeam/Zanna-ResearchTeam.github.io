Our current projects are focused on: 

üåä Multiscale Ocean Dynamics: ocean turbulence and mixing; large scale ocean and atmospheric transport; extreme events. 

üß† AI for Science - in particular, AI for Ocean/Climate Physics: e.g., algorithms and data-driven models that respect the laws of physics; extracting new physics from data; foundation models for ocean + climate.  

üßë‚Äçüíª Dynamical Systems & Numerical Modeling: stochastic differential equations; fluctuation-dissaption theory; optimization; adjoint methods; hybrid (AI + physics) methods. 

üåé We are leading M<sup>2</sup>LInES - Multiscale Machine Learning In Coupled Earth System Modeling - a large international collaborative project with the goal of improving climate simulations, using AI. More info [here](https://m2lines.github.io/).
