üë®‚Äçüíª Interested in working with us: Generally, I welcome applications from students and researchers with strong background in applied math, applied physics and/or numerical methods interested in quantitative ocean/climate physics (using theory, numerics, AI). Please browse our [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xWZmhjsAAAAJ&hl=en) and [GitHub](https://github.com/Zanna-ResearchTeam) to get an idea of our recent research projects. Feel free to reach out to group members if you have any inquiries about our research. Given the volume of emails I receive, it is unlikely that I will be able to reply to emails with basic initial enquiries. 

üí° Graduate Students: I am accepting PhD students through [Math/CAOS](https://caos.cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/phd-program/overview/), [Applied Math](https://math.nyu.edu/dynamic/graduate/phd-mathematics/), and [CDS](https://cds.nyu.edu/phd-admissions-req/). Read carefully the application pages for details about the program, application, requirements, etc. If you are interested in working with me, make sure you mention my name in your application, including your research statement. Unfortunately, I won't be able to respond until your application is submitted to NYU. 

üß† Postdoctoral Researchers: If you are interested in joining us to work on AI + Ocean/Climate. Please check the M¬≤LInES [website](https://m2lines.github.io/) for opportunities. Otherwise, you can explore independent fellowships (NSF, Simons Junior Fellows), feel free to send me a CV + a 1-page research statement (Note that I won't be able to reply to most enquiries).
