### Research Focus

Hosted at the Courant Institute School of Mathematics, Computing, and Data Science, the Center addresses fundamental challenges in geophysical systems, including:

* Multiscale interactions in the ocean, atmosphere, and ice

* The physics and precursors of rare, high-impact events

* Advanced methods at the intersection of numerical modeling and artificial intelligence


### Mission & Activities

The Simons Center for Computational Geophysical Flows fosters collaboration across applied mathematics, data science, and computer science. Its activities include:

* Independent postdoctoral fellowships

* Visiting professorships

* Invited seminars and thematic workshops

* Support for outstanding graduate students

* Hosting leading visiting scholars
