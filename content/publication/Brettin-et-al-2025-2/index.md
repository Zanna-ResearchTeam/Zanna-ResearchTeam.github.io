# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: 'Reliable dynamic sea level forecasts are hindered by numerous sources of uncertainty on daily-to-seasonal timescales (1-180 days) due to atmospheric boundary conditions and internal ocean variability. Studies have demonstrated that certain initial states can extend predictability horizons; thus, identifying these initial conditions may help improve forecast skill. Here, we identify sources of dynamic sea level predictability on daily-to-seasonal timescales using neural networks trained on CESM2 large ensemble data to forecast dynamic sea level. The forecasts yield not only a point estimate for sea level but also a standard deviation to quantify forecast uncertainty based on the initial conditions. Forecasted uncertainties can be leveraged to identify state-dependent sources of predictability at most locations and forecast leads. Network forecasts, particularly in the low-latitude Indo-Pacific, exhibit skillful deterministic predictions and skillfully forecast exceedance probabilities relative to local linear baselines. For networks trained at Guam and in the western Indian Ocean, the transfer of sources of predictability from local sources to remote sources is presented by the deteriorating utility of initial condition information for predicting exceedance events. Propagating Rossby waves are identified as a potential source of predictability for dynamic sea level at Guam. In the Indian Ocean, persistence of thermosteric sea level anomalies from the Indian Ocean Dipole may be a source of predictability on subseasonal timescales, but El Niño drives predictability on seasonal timescales. This work shows how uncertainty-quantifying machine learning can help identify changes in sources of state-dependent predictability over a range of forecast leads.'
