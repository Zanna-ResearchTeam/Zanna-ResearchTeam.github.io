abstract: 'The degree to which the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation
(AMOC) weakens over the twenty-first century varies widely across climate
models, with some predicting substantial weakening. Here we show that
this uncertainty can be greatly reduced by using a thermal-wind expression
that relates the AMOC strength to the meridional density difference
and the overturning depth in the Atlantic. This expression captures the
intermodel spread in AMOC weakening, with most of the spread arising
from overturning depth changes. The overturning depth also establishes
a crucial link between the present-day and future AMOC strength. Climate
models with a stronger and deeper present-day overturning tend to predict
larger weakening and shoaling under warming because the present-day
North Atlantic is less stratified, allowing for a deeper penetration of surface
buoyancy flux changes, larger density changes at depth and, consequently,
larger AMOC weakening. By incorporating observational constraints, we
conclude that the AMOC will experience limited weakening of about 3–6 Sv
(about 18–43%) by the end of this century, regardless of emissions scenario.
These results indicate that the uncertainty in twenty-first-century AMOC
weakening and the propensity to predict substantial AMOC weakening can
be attributed primarily to climate model biases in accurately simulating the
present-day ocean stratification.'
