# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
abstract: 'Mass loss from the Antarctic ice sheet is projected to continue over the coming
century. The resultant sea level change will have a regional pattern that evolves over time as the
ocean adjusts. Accurate estimation of this evolution is crucial for local communities. Current
state-of-the-art climate models typically do not couple ice sheets to the atmosphere-ocean system,
and the impact of ice sheet melt has often been studied by injecting meltwater at the model ocean
surface. However, observational evidence suggests that most Antarctic meltwater enters the ocean
at depth through ice shelf basal melt. A previous study has demonstrated that the regional sea level
pattern at a given time depends on meltwater injection depth. Here, we introduce a 2.5-layer model
to investigate this dependence and develop a theory for the associated adjustment mechanisms. We
find mechanisms consistent with previous literature on the ocean adjustment to changes in forcing,
whereby a slower Rossby wave response off the eastern boundary follows a fast response from the
western boundary current and Kelvin waves. We demonstrate that faster baroclinic Rossby waves
near the surface than at depth explains the injection depth dependence of the adjustment in the
2.5-layer model. The identified Rossby wave mechanism may contribute to the dependence of the
ocean’s transient adjustment on meltwater injection depth in more complex models. This work
highlights processes that could cause errors in the projection of the time-varying pattern of sea
level rise using surface meltwater input to represent Antarctica’s freshwater forcing.'
