abstract = {Abstract Parameterizations of \$O(1-10)\$km submesoscale mixed layer instabilities in General Circulation Models (GCMs) represent the effects of unresolved vertical buoyancy fluxes (VBF) in the ocean mixed layer. These submesoscale flows interact non-linearly with mesoscale and boundary layer turbulence, and it is challenging to account for all the relevant processes in physics-based parameterizations. In this work, we present a data-driven approach for the submesoscale parameterization, that relies on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained to predict mixed layer VBF as a function of relevant large-scale variables. The data used for training is given from 12 regions sampled from the global high-resolution MITgcm-LLC4320 simulation. When compared with the baseline of a submesoscale physics-based parameterization, the CNN demonstrates high offline skill across all regions, seasons, and filter scales tested in this study. During seasons when submesoscales are most active, which generally corresponds to winter and spring months, we find that the CNN prediction skill tends to be lower than in summer months. The CNN exhibits a dependency on the large scale strain field, a variable closely related to frontogenesis, which is currently missing from the submesoscale parameterizations in GCMs.},
