abstract = {We propose a multiscale approach for predicting quantities in dynamical systems which is explicitly structured to extract information in both fine-to-coarse and coarse-to-fine directions. Our approach improves model accuracy and stability with minimally increased computation compared to non-multiscale approaches with analogous network architecture. We evaluate our approach on an idealized fluid subgrid parameterization (known as closure) task in which our multiscale networks correct chaotic underlying models to reflect the contributions of unresolved, fine-scale dynamics.}
