The authors argue that now is the time to advance beyond current techniques by developing more accurate machine-learning-based Earth system models and creating new tools for predicting extreme events, improving detection methods, and enhancing climate model analysis. The review emphasizes the importance of collaboration between machine learning experts and climate scientists, along with the involvement of the private sector, to drive innovation and progress in climate science.

Researchers, including &lt;strong>Laure Zanna&lt;/strong> and CliMA members, reduced this uncertainty by linking AMOC strength to the meridional density difference and overturning depth. They found that models with a deeper present-day overturning predict greater weakening due to less stratified North Atlantic waters. Using observational data, they estimate a modest AMOC weakening of about 4 Sv by century&amp;rsquo;s end, regardless of emissions. The &lt;a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-4456168/v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study&lt;/a> highlights that inaccuracies in current ocean stratification models lead to exaggerated predictions of AMOC weakening.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>InMOS selected by Schmidt Sciences to Advance Understanding of Ocean Systems in a Changing Climate</title><link>https://Zanna-ResearchTeam.github.io/post/24-06-03-inmos/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Zanna-ResearchTeam.github.io/post/24-06-03-inmos/</guid><description>&lt;p>Schmidt Sciences &lt;a href="https://www.schmidtsciences.org/five-projects-will-receive-funding-to-advance-understanding-of-ocean-systems-in-a-changing-climate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced&lt;/a> that five global science and technology projects have been selected to join the &lt;a href="https://www.schmidtsciences.org/the-ocean-biogeochemistry-virtual-institute-obvi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ocean Biogeochemistry Virtual Institute (OBVI)&lt;/a> addressing gaps in ocean data and modeling efforts.

&lt;p>The press release can be found &lt;a href="https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2020/august/researchers-identify-human-influence-as-key-agent-of-ocean-warmi.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here&lt;/a>. In this &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2573-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paper&lt;/a> we highlight a relationship between heat and carbon to reveal the effect of changes in ocean circulation from CO2 forcing on patterns of ocean warming in both observations and global Earth system models from the Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We find that 1) the global heat to carbon uptake is linear and due to the background ocean state; 2) patterns of anthropogenic carbon and added heat (when the circulation is unchanged) are similar.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We show that historical patterns of ocean warming are shaped by ocean heat redistribution, which CMIP5 models simulate poorly. However, we find that projected patterns of heat storage are primarily dictated by the pre-industrial ocean circulation (and small changes in unresolved ocean processes)—that is, by the patterns of added heat owing to ocean uptake of excess atmospheric heat rather than ocean warming by circulation changes. Climate models show more skill in simulating ocean heat storage by the pre-industrial circulation compared to heat redistribution, indicating that warming patterns of the ocean may become more predictable as the climate warms.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Learning equations for ocean turbulence using machine learning</title><link>https://Zanna-ResearchTeam.github.io/post/deeplearning/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Zanna-ResearchTeam.github.io/post/deeplearning/</guid><description>&lt;p>Neural Nets + Physics vs. Equation-discovery for parameterization&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Our new approach to the parameterization/closure problem: learning differential equations of missing physics in coarse-res ocean models from data. We use a machine learning (ML) method that relies on sparse Bayesian inference / relevance vector machine to learn ocean eddy parameterizations of momentum, buoyancy, and energy. We compare it to a ML parameterization which uses convolutional neural nets with conservation-law embedded in the architecture. Each approach has pros and cons (interpretability, generalization, numerical stability) in our proof-of-concept. Many aspects need to be improved but we are moving one step closer towards blending physics and machine learning for climate modeling.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New Paper on Causes of 20th Century sea level</title><link>https://Zanna-ResearchTeam.github.io/post/sea-level-20th/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Zanna-ResearchTeam.github.io/post/sea-level-20th/</guid><description>&lt;p>Published in Nature.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The work shows that we can close the ‘sea-level budget’ since 1900 and therefore explain the causes of the observed changes in sea level over the 20th century.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Global sea level has risen by about 20 cm since 1900, which has been caused by thermal expansion and ice melt, while there is now more liquid water stored on land than in 1900. The decrease is due to the fact that we have impounded a lot of water in dammed reservoirs. All the new dams almost brought sea-level rise to a halt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the 20th century, most sea-level rise is caused by glacier melt, while the recently increased mass loss Greenland and Antarctica are catching up quickly. Sea level is also rising at an accelerated rate because of thermal expansion.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New Climate Process Team</title><link>https://Zanna-ResearchTeam.github.io/post/cpt/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://Zanna-ResearchTeam.github.io/post/cpt/</guid><description>&lt;p>CPT Ocean Transport and Eddy Energy funded by NSF and NOAA&lt;/p>
